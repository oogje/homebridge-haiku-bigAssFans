`homebridge-haiku-bigassfans` is a plugin for Homebridge which allows you to control a Big Ass Fans model Haiku.

This might with your LED equipped Haiku fan.  I created the plugin by observing network traffic and for the 
most part guessing the format of the binary messages that were sent to and from the fan.  Of the appoximately 80 unique 
message types I've seen, I think I know what about half of them probably mean.

### Bugs

The network connection to the fan will reset on occassion.  I try to handle that gracefully but if it happens just as you
issue a command (e.g., turn on the light) as oppposed to the periodic probe message, the command will be ignored.  Try again after two seconds.


### Features

* Turn fan and/or light on or off!
<!-- * Change speed, and direction (keep in mind Big Ass Fans frowns on reversing speed.)
* Change brightness level of LED lamp.
* See the fan's bluetooth remote's temperature and humidity sensors.
* Turn Whoosh Mode on or off.
* Turn Dim to Warm on or off.
* Turn fan's Auto mode on or off. -->

### Installation

If you are not already running homebridge you'll find how to install it in the homebridge [documentation](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge#readme).  After you install homebridge you can install and configure the `homebridge-haiku-bigassfans` plugin through `homebridge-config-ui-x` using a command line and editor as described below.

#### Configuration

Add your fan(s) in the `fans` array.

      "platform": "BigAssFans-haiku",
            "fans": [
