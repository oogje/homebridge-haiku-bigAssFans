### homebridge-haiku-bigassfans

`homebridge-haiku-bigassfans` was to be a Haiuku compatable version of [homebridge-haiku-bigAssFans](https://github.com/oogje/homebridge-i6-bigAssFans/) but in spring of 2022 Big Ass Fans provided Haiku owners a firware update that allowed their fans to work with [homebridge-haiku-bigAssFans](https://github.com/oogje/homebridge-i6-bigAssFans/), obviating the need for this plugin.

Please see [homebridge-haiku-bigAssFans](https://github.com/oogje/homebridge-i6-bigAssFans/).
